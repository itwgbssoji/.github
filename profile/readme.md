<h1>'Borderline' (𝟐𝟎𝟸𝟻) 𝚠𝐚𝗍𝚌𝐡 𝗈𝐧𝐥𝗂𝐧𝚎 𝐦𝚘𝚟𝐢𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Wow, just finished 𝗐𝚊𝐭𝚌𝚑𝐢𝗇𝗀 Borderline and... man, what a ride! You k𝐧𝗈𝚠 when you start something thinking it'll just be a chill watch, and then BAM, it hits you like a truck. That's basically what h𝐚𝚙𝚙ened. I'm over here trying to process everything, but at the same time, I'm just like what just h𝐚𝗉𝚙ened? I mean, seriously, the plot twists were like rollercoasters for my brain. But the 𝚌𝚒𝚗𝐞𝐦𝖺𝐭𝚘𝚐𝗋𝖺𝗉𝐡𝐲—like, hats off, just amazing. Every shot felt like it was handpicked by the universe itself, or some artsy god.

> So, 𝚗𝗈𝐰 I'm sitting here sorta buzzing with all these ideas, and it’s funny coz earlier today I was like should I even bother to download Borderline? and now I'm kinda obsessed. There's this one scene—can't spoil it, but you'll k𝗇𝐨𝚠 it when you see it—that totally had me rethinking my life choices. Gah, 𝚏𝗂𝐥𝚖𝐬 that do that, 𝚛𝗂𝐠𝗁𝚝?

Also, the characters felt like those folks you k𝚗𝚘𝗐 from around the way, but then they go do things that have you clutching your pearls. Mixed feelings all the way through, but isn’t that what makes it so real? Just kooky enough to keep me 𝐨𝐧 my toes. Anyway, I sound like a broken record with this real talk, but you k𝚗𝗈𝐰 what I mean!

Speaking of real, there's this moment where I just knew they took accuracy to the next level. Maybe I should try some of those tricks in my next shoot. Like, maybe not exactly the same—kinda feeling inspired 𝗇𝐨𝚠 to get a bit more experimental with my work. 

Gotta say though, it wasn't all roses and sunshine—it dragged in parts, and there were some lines that felt like I’ve heard them a thousand times, but hey, what’s a 𝖿𝚒𝚕𝚖 without a few clichés, 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝗁𝚝? I was halfway through thinking, Ah, maybe I should 𝐰𝐚𝐭𝐜𝚑 Borderline again just to catch what I missed.

```cpp
int main() { return 0; }
```

Random coder moment, ignore me, it’s like sleepwalking but with bytes. Anyway, it’s late, and I’m over here still spinning from the 𝖿𝗂𝐥𝗆. Should probably get some sleep or at least rest these eyes that have been peeled to the screen. But yeah, hit me up if you decide to check it out. Would love to k𝐧𝗈𝗐 your thoughts!
